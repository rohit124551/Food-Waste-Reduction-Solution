        <li class="intro">Food waste is food that is intended for human consumption that is wasted and lost, and refers not only to food that consumers donâ€™t finish at restaurants and are thrown out at home, but also raw materials and produce that are lost in the farming stage, harvesting processes, during transportation, and storage. Food waste can occur anywhere throughout the entire supply chain.
